- Assuming the Star Wars API was slow, what are some optimizations that could be implemented to improve the user experience?
	- Instead of just a simple spinner, I would implement a progress bar so users know how much longer it will take for the data to load.

- Any improvements you would make to your application?
  - A search function, unit tests, more data, and a better ui.
